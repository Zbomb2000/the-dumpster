# The Dumpster
This is the dumpster. This is where I put reusable code from my other projects.

## Folders
 - ```cd``` - This gets the path to the parent directory of the script


 - ```tk``` - This is a tkinter window


 - ```json``` - This loads and writes json data


 - ```email``` - This sends an email
